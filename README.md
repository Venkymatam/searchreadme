# Search!

Hi! 
This is a project for the CS50's web programming with Python and JS. 

Harvard's CS50 2020 Course Site - [CS50 Website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)


# Specifications
	I will be listing the required Specifications and Easy to understand explanation of the same
## Pages 
> Your website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

   I have created Three web pages.
- [index.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/index.html) 
- [imagesearch.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/imagesearch.html)
- [AdvancedSearch.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/AdvancedSearch.html)

## Query Text
>On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

This is [index.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/index.html) (Hosted on GitHub Pages)


This Google Search page contains a search bar along with a google search button which when clicked redirects to the Google results page of the Query.

It also contains an `I'm Feeling Lucky` Button which when clicked redirects to the first result of the Google Search page

## Query Images

> On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

This is [imagesearch.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/imagesearch.html)  (Hosted on GitHub Pages)


Similar to the Search page, This page too contains a search bar along with an Image search button. 

The search bar allows the user to input their query, along with a hidden input for value `isch` which takes the make `tbm`.

The Image search button when clicked redirects to the Google Images page of the query.

## Query Advanced.

>On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields

This is [AdvancedSearch.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/AdvancedSearch.html))  (Hosted on GitHub Pages)

This webpage has 4 input boxes and depicts googles own [Advanced Search](https://google.com/advanced_search)
This site allows the user to input multiple values and generates the required `URL` request. 

To get the styling of the button and text I used DevTools.

## Appearance

>Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.

As is obvious on [AdvancedSearch.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/AdvancedSearch.html), The four input fields are vertically Stacked and all four text fields are left-aligned.  
>Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query.

As can be seen, the Advanced Search button is blue on top of which White text is present.

It mimics Google's very own Advanced Search button.

This button when clicked redirects the user to search results page for their given query.



## Lucky.

>Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

As is evident on [index.html](https://venkymatam.github.io/GoogleSearch/index.html),

I have added an `I'm Feeling Lucky` button which when clicked redirects to the first URL provided in the search results page.


## Aesthetics
>The CSS you write should match Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible.

The CSS I have written makes the site look very similar to the 2020 Google homepage.
